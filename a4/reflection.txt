## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnParser` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a dodecahedron?
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edges 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: The recursive infix and postfix implementations for the necessary Expression classes was
   tricky to understand. Figuring out that the nodes can have their child nodes call the same method
   to evaluate themselves through recursion was the breakthrough for the implementation.
