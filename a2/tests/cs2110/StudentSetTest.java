    // test case here for the method being implemented, then repeat the above (confirm that it
    // fails, implement the method, confirm that it passes).  This TODO is complete when there are
    // test cases covering all of `StudentSet`'s public methods.
    // Be sure that at least one test case triggers a resize, given your chosen initial capacity.
