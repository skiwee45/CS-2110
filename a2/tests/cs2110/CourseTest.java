    // TODO 14: Write a test case that covers `Course`'s constructor and the observers that have
    // already been implemented in the release code.  Confirm that the case initially fails, then
    // complete TODOs 15-16 and return here to confirm that your case now passes.
    // As you proceed with TODOs 17-22, start by adding a test case here for the method being
    // implemented, then repeat the above (confirm that it fails, implement the method, confirm that
    // it passes).  This TODO is complete when there are test cases covering all of `Course`'s
    // public methods.
    // Be sure to verify any effects on objects of other classes as well.
